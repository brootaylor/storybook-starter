# Storybook Starter

Setting up a pattern component library using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

Even though I'm familiar with [Fractal](https://fractal.build/) - (and find it my tool of choice for most of my front-end projects so far) - I was keen to try out Storybook and see if it can work with my style of designing and developing.
